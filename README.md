# OpenAI GPT-3 Chatbot Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model into a chatbot application. It utilizes Google Cloud Functions as the serverless compute platform to create an API endpoint that accepts user queries and generates responses using the GPT-3 model.

## Features

- Provides a Google Cloud Function named `generate_gpt_text` that receives a user query as a JSON request and returns a response generated by GPT-3.
- Handles the authentication with OpenAI API using the provided API key.
- Validates the request payload and ensures the necessary parameters are present.
- Sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the user query using the GPT-3 model.
- Extracts the generated response from the API response and returns it to the user.

## Usage

To use the chatbot API, make a POST request to the API endpoint with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "query": "Hello, how are you?"
}
```

The API will respond with a generated response from the chatbot.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7
- Flask
- Requests

## Setup and Deployment

To deploy the chatbot API on Google Cloud Functions, follow these steps:

1. Set up a Google Cloud project and enable Cloud Functions.
2. Create a new Cloud Function and specify the entry point as `generate_gpt_text` in the `main.py` file.
3. Set up the necessary environment variables, including the OpenAI API key.
4. Deploy the function to Google Cloud Functions using the command-line interface or the Cloud Console.

## Limitations

- The chatbot API has rate limits imposed by the OpenAI API.
- The performance of the chatbot depends on the response time of the OpenAI API.
- The quality and accuracy of the generated responses are dependent on the GPT-3 model.
